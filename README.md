DigiByte-Sentinel-AI

AI-based anomaly detection & threat-monitoring system for the DigiByte blockchain

⸻

Overview

DigiByte-Sentinel-AI is a modular, lightweight, real-time anomaly detection engine designed to enhance the security of the DigiByte blockchain.
It performs continuous analysis of transactions, block patterns, signature entropy, and network behavior using a hybrid statistical–ML model.

The goal is to provide the DigiByte ecosystem with an autonomous early-warning system against:
	•	irregular transaction bursts
	•	potential 51% attack indicators
	•	address behavior drift
	•	low-entropy or weak digital signatures
	•	chain manipulation attempts
	•	suspicious miner activity
	•	cross-chain exploit patterns

Key Features

1. Real-time anomaly scoring

Extracts 6 core metrics per transaction and assigns a security score from 0.0 to 1.0.

2. Intelligent risk classification
	•	normal
	•	elevated
	•	high
	•	critical

3. Lightweight hybrid model

No GPU required — optimized for running on nodes, servers, or monitoring dashboards.

4. REST API endpoint

Enables wallets, explorers, miners, and exchanges to query the engine:
POST /sentinel/analyze
5. Event logging

Every analyzed transaction includes a timestamp and structured JSON log output.

Architecture

Data ingestion
	•	Pulls transaction metadata
	•	Computes statistical and behavioral metrics
	•	Feeds vectorized data into the scoring model

Scoring engine

Uses blended weights across:
	•	amount deviation
	•	address recurrence
	•	low-entropy signature detection
	•	frequency anomaly
	•	miner pattern recognition
	•	multi-factor irregularities

Output

JSON object containing:
	•	anomaly score
	•	classification
	•	timestamp
	•	input metrics
Installation
	1.	Clone repository
	2.	Install dependencies:
